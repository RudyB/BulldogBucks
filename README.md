#### The Bulldog Bucks App was designed for Gonzaga University students to quickly and easily check their Bulldog Buck balance.

This app was designed with a simple one-time login in mind. Once you're signed in, you don't even have to open the app to check your balance. Use the nifty today center widget to check your balance of the fly.

No more wasting time logging in and clicking around on Zagweb.
